# Welcome to crazytown! Where all your wishes will not come true.

## PHASE ONE 

``` In the first phase I want you to make a counter. The counter should appear on the page when you load it, and should count down from 10. When it reaches zero, there should be an alert on the page. (This could be an alert box og a message on the page). Feel free to write whatever text you want in that alert message! When the alertbox, or message has appeared, continue to next phase ```

## PHASE TWO

``` In this phase I want a button. When you click on the button and image/or animation should appear. The picture should show on the page. You can decide on what photo/animation you would like to show. I would prefer something horror related... ```

## PHASE THREE 

``` So now you have created a button that will show and image/animation. Now I want you to make a button that will make the image/animation disappear.```

## PHASE FOUR

``` The last and final phase! Here I want you to create a button that will change the background color! I want it to change between 4 colors! ```

## And now you are done!!!!
